### Instructions

1.This project requires python to be installed on the local system

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. 

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, 

4. From the two selection filters, select an area and a cuisine then choose from one of the restaurants show. This will take you to a page containing more details and review. 

5. Use the bread crumb trail to move back to the main page, or the back button.
